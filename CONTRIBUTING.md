# Contributing Guidelines
If you're interested in contributing to this project, here are a few ways to do so:

### Bug fixes
* If you find a bug, report it in our repository.
* Issues that have already been identified as a bug will be labelled ~"type::bug" .
* If you'd like to submit a fix for a bug, send a Merge Request from your own fork.
* Include a test that isolates the bug and verifies that it was fixed.
* Also update the example and documentation if necessary.

### New Features
* If you'd like to add a feature to the library that doesn't already exist, feel free to describe the feature on our repository's Issues page.
* Issues that have been identified as a feature request will be labelled ~"type::feature".
* If you'd like to implement the new feature, please wait for feedback from the project maintainers before spending too much time writing the code. In some cases, enhancements may not align well with the project objectives at the time.
* Also update the example and documentation where needed.

### Documentation & Miscellaneous
* If you think the documentation could be clearer, or you have an alternative implementation of something that may have more advantages, we would love to hear it.
* Issues that have been identified as a documentation change will be labelled ~"type::documentation".
* Implement the changes to the documentation.

# Requirements
For a contribution to be accepted:

* Code must follow existing styling conventions
* Commit message should start with an issue number and should also be descriptive.

If the contribution doesn't meet these criteria, a maintainer will discuss it with you on the issue. You can still continue to add more commits to the branch you have sent the Merge Request from.
